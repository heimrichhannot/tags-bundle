# Tags Bundle extension for Contao Open Source CMS

**This bundle should only be used until `codefog/tags-bundle` version 3 is released and supports `alias`, `maxItems` and InsertTags `{{tags_title::}}`**

Tags Bundle is an extension for the [Contao Open Source CMS](https://contao.org).

The extension provides the tagging functionality in Contao. Backend widget is powered up by the excellent
UI widget [selectize.js](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js) that allows to easily manage tags.

> This project is aimed at the developers and it does not provide tagging to any of standard Contao 
  features by default!
